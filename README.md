# Getting to Know You

_The API that's *in your face!*_

## Introduction

Starting a new job is hard _enough_ without having to go about the business of learning _everyone's_ name.  In a ground-breaking new study led by that guy whose name I can't remember that cost the taxpayers $42, 
grant-funded researchers have just discovered that nobody really bothers to force themselves to remember names when they meet new people.  It was reported in one case that one man - who had been working
in the same position for 42 years, in a cube farm with just 15 other people (the newest of whom had begun work 16 years prior) - could not name a single coworker.  

He was able to recall each person's face, and could
even converse with most of them about their stresses, families, joys, vacations, and other characteristics, both professional and personal; however, when asked how he addresses them, he replied, "Well, I guess I just
try to avoid situations requiring me to call out their name.  Like, when I need someone, I just say, 'Hey man! Can I get some help?' Or, 'Yes ma'am, I can have that right away!'" 

The research further revealed that almost _everyone_ uses this same tactic.  The study was so alarming that several representatives introduced new legislation that would force new employees to name every single co-worker
within the first two weeks of employment, with the failure to do so resulting in up to one disaproving look, or several awkward conversations.    

_*Getting to Know You*_ is an API that presents a framework for anyone to build fun and engaging games designed to help new employees get to recognize their workmates.  Simply configure it with your own internal workforce's
employee name and mugshot locations, and have fun!
